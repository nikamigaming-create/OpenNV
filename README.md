# Open Nevada

**Open Nevada** (OpenNV) is an independent Godot-based runtime, direct retail
content pipeline, and cross-platform launcher for worlds built from game assets
that a player legally owns. Its engine, interface, product identity, and
launcher contract are Open Nevada's own.

> **Live:** **[opennevada.com](https://opennevada.com)** is the public Open
> Nevada home. **[opennv.org](https://opennv.org)** is the short technical and
> community address, permanently forwarding to the canonical site.

Playable runtime downloads are paused while the new first-party Godot runtime
passes its promotion gates. GitHub remains the source and future release
authority; archived previews are not the current runtime.

The first-party desktop launcher has a portable Electron shell for Windows,
macOS, and Linux. It now reads the in-repository Godot runtime manifest directly
instead of using a Windows-only engine bridge. Runtime builds are promoted per
platform only after the same campaign and compatibility tests pass. See [the
launcher architecture](docs/desktop-launcher.md).
See [the domain deployment plan](docs/domains.md) and [Cloudflare Pages
handoff](docs/cloudflare-pages.md) before publishing the public site or a
redirect.

Open Nevada ships no commercial game assets, DLC, conversion output, or
third-party mod archives. Players provide those from lawful sources.

## Character path is a real choice

Choose the path **before creating a character**. Each choice has its own
profile and save boundary.

| Path | Character | JAM rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| New Vegas | Separate standalone Mojave character | Start base and add JAM later, or begin with JAM. Keep JAM enabled after a save uses it. |
| Fallout 3 | Separate standalone Capital Wasteland character | Vanilla standalone route. Choose TTW at character creation if the character should continue into the combined world. |
| TTW | One Capital Wasteland-to-Mojave character | A separate combined-world path, base or JAM. It cannot be retrofitted onto an existing standalone save. |

This makes the important distinction visible rather than hiding it in mod
files: JAM is modular; TTW is a character-path decision.

## Mod support without a Windows-only ceiling

Open Nevada accepts content and mod sources through isolated profiles rather
than touching a game installation. A Windows-only native plugin is not a
product-level exclusion. It enters a compatibility pipeline:

1. record the extension behavior and its needed events/commands;
2. implement a portable OpenNV semantic contract in the runtime;
3. run the real mod through a recorded launch validation;
4. promote it to *supported* only when that behavior is reproducible.

That is how major extender-dependent mods can work across platforms without
pretending that an arbitrary Windows DLL is safe to load into a different
runtime. The current catalog distinguishes validated modules from ones still
waiting on an extender bridge. See [the mod policy](docs/mods.md).

## Current Godot development slice

The current checked-in slice is a playable Goodsprings sandbox, not only a
renderer. The current hash-pinned retail baseline resolves 228 interior/exterior
assets, 504 enabled placements, 379 textures, 476 materials, 97 authored saloon
pickups, five containers, 27 lights, and a
reciprocal XTEL pair joining the saloon to WastelandNV cell `[-17,0]`. LAND
geometry and its 24 authored texture layers form the exterior ground. Sunny
Smiles and the seated settler load inside; Easy Pete loads at his exterior ACHR.
The promoted route collects the saloon's real `.357`, fires using
its retail damage/clip/ammo profile, takes an authored Beer, loots a resolved
authored crate, opens both sides of the linked door, walks and shoots through
the opening, autosaves, exits, and restores the exact state in a second process.

CI pins the official Godot 4.7.1 Mono Windows archive by SHA-256
`764a089809fb1a6f745686ce9f6d3ca83adce8fb60fb9a4e2324b63baaebaa45`.

```powershell
python -m pip install -r content/requirements-build.txt
.\scripts\Test-GodotRuntime.ps1
.\scripts\Test-GodotRuntime.ps1 `
  -FalloutNewVegasData 'D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Fallout New Vegas\Data'
```

`Build-GodotRuntime.ps1` packages the legal-content helper with the experimental
Windows export. The resulting `OpenNV.exe` lets a player select their owned
Fallout: New Vegas installation folder or its `Data` folder directly; it does
not require Python or another engine at runtime.

This is a playable experimental sandbox, not the full New Vegas campaign. See the
[canonical whole-game delivery plan](docs/whole-game-delivery-plan.md),
[single-page architecture](docs/architecture.md),
[data and configuration accountability contract](docs/data-and-configuration-accountability.md),
[installation status](docs/installation.md), [clean implementation boundary](docs/clean-room.md),
and [release policy](docs/nightlies.md).

Flat play and OpenXR are first-class modes over one shared game/save state. The
OpenXR software path is launchable with a bounded Meta Touch action map,
metre-correct rig, two owned-data retail hands, controller locomotion/actions,
haptics, and a wrist HUD. The repo-local simulator passes both sticks, snap
turn, door/fire/reload/save, supported eye height, and native stereo capture. A
connected-headset final-eye validation is still required before calling VR ready.
The owned-data Saloon slice also includes an experimental practice pool table:
the intact retail table triangles, authored cue/rack/four placed balls, NIF
convex bodies, shared flat/OpenXR strike simulation, and v2 save state are
software-gated. Full eight-ball rules and physical headset acceptance are not
claimed.

## Release contents

Future runtime releases will contain the exported Godot runtime, direct content
contracts, launcher, and source-revision metadata. They will not contain:

- commercial game files, DLC, or conversion output;
- third-party mod archives or downloader credentials;
- a player's saves, profiles, or mod-manager state.

No playable Godot runtime is currently published. Historical preview archives
retain the notices that applied when they were built; see [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md).
